Draw it or lose it was the client and needed a new server system that would allow multiple users with differnt OS access their servers.

I felt that I did a good job of understanding the clients needs and trying to provide them with the best options. 

I did struggle with the code and found that using free websites to help you with problems the best. 

I would say my code needs to be better but overall I think the products were successful. 

In order to give the customer the best that they need you have to customize to them. Which should be done with the software design. 

I believe using a UML Diagram is one of the better ways to start software design and again focus on what the customer needs.
